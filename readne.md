MVC homework

I'd like to first mention that the biggest problems I encountered during this homework was folder configuration. I feel like everything was outta place. I spent a lot of time trying to structure this homework

Anyway, my implementation of this homework is what I call the "lazy way".  In other words, I tried to make my life as easy as possible while still maintaining the guidelines.  When I say " as easy as possible," I did a lot of copy and paste from our last activities in class. our last class activity was horrendous, I know right thats a big word thats how bad it was.  



language we used in this project was mainly JavaScript nad NodeJS and its modules also mySQL. 

And finally... (drumroll please...)

I enjoyed this home work really, even though it was dificult I still enjoyed it because our TA is the best, shout out to Jorge AKA George
